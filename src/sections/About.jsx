        About Me
      </h2>

      <p className="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        I’m a Web3 and full-stack developer focused on building secure, well-structured
        decentralized applications. I work mainly with Solidity, Hardhat, and modern
        frontend tools like React and Next.js, with strong attention to smart contract
        security, testing, and user experience.
        <br /><br />
        Before specializing in Web3, I spent several years working in a small company
        environment, where I gained hands-on experience with front-end development,
        website maintenance, and content management. This period helped me build a
        strong technical foundation, problem-solving mindset, and the ability to adapt
        quickly to real-world requirements.
        <br /><br />
        Today, my focus is on contributing to meaningful blockchain products, continuously
        improving code quality, security, and overall system design.
